        <li>500 grams beef (cut into cubes)</li>
        <li>1/2 cup yogurt</li>

        Add the ginger-garlic paste and sauté for a minute until fragrant. <br>
        Add the marinated beef along with its marinade. <br> Cook on high heat until  the beef is browned and the oil starts <br> to separate from the mixture.
